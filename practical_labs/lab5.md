## Lab 5 - Cross-Validation for Model Selection

**There are no changes to the regular submission process. Simply provide a link to a live HTML through eConestoga**

### Task

1. Utilize the diabetes dataset from lab 4. Perform cross-validation on nine polynomial models, ranging from degree 0 to 8. (2 points)
2. Construct a table summarizing the cross-validation results. Each model should have a separate row in the table. Include the R-Squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and MAPE metrics for each model. Calculate the mean value and standard deviation of these metrics from the cross-validation. Include both values. (2 points)
3. Identification of the Best Model: Identify the model that exhibits the highest performance based on the R-Squared, MAE and MAPE metrics. Provide an explanation for choosing this specific model. (1 points)
4. Additional analysis and interpretation of the models' performances. You may explore further insights beyond the required metrics. The analysis should provide at least one relevant insight about the choice of the best model, or about characteristics of the chosen one (for example - an analysis of in which instances does it fail) (1 point).
